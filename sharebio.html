    <h1> Sharebio </h1>
    <h3> <i>Center of excellence for bioinformatics research</i> </h3>
    <p>
        Last summer, I overhauled the design of the Sharebio research
        coalition, which hosts bioinformatics research
        materials shared between Reed College, Whitworth
        University, and Lewis & Clark College.
        Along with cleaning up the site's UI, I also patched issues with
        existing website infrastructure, which ran on the Yii2 PHP
        framework and used the hosting service ownCloud to store project
        files.

        <h2>Displaying Projects</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest user experience challenges on the site was making the best of the
            space available on each project thumbnail. Given that each project had a unique identifier
            on the database but no way to view it on the front end, I added an ID number to each project,
            which also helped distinguish projects with similar names or images. <br> <br>
            The other major consideration was permissions, since each user had to request access to view
            and edit the files of other people's projects. Here, I used icons to indicate that the
            status of each request, and to help communicate that projects would be opened elsewhere- in
            this case, in a new tab on ownCloud, which was where all of the project files were stored.

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>
            While I was working on testing project creation and modification, I noticed
            that aside from the favicon, Sharebio's logo was only used once on the entire site.
            The logo also used the site's tagline but didn't incorporate it's name, which made
            it potentially confusing out of context. <br> <br>
            As I brainstormed a new one, I made sure to include the site's accent color, as
            well as the original's iconic microscope. I went with a wordmark logo so it could
            fit in the upper-left navbar where it would be readily seen by first-time visitors.
