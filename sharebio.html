    <h1> Sharebio </h1>
    <h3> <i>Center of excellence for bioinformatics research</i> </h3>
    <p>
        Last summer, I overhauled the design of the Sharebio research
        coalition, which hosts bioinformatics research
        materials shared between Reed College, Whitworth
        University, and Lewis & Clark College. 
        Along with cleaning up the site's UI, I also patched issues with 
        existing website infrastructure, which ran on the Yii2 PHP 
        framework and used the hosting service ownCloud to store project 
        files.

        <p>
            While I was working on testing project creation and modification, I noticed
            that aside from the favicon, Sharebio's logo was only used once on the entire site.
            The logo also used the site's tagline but didn't incorporate it's name, which made 
            it potentially confusing out of context. <br> <br>
            As I brainstormed a new one, I made sure to include the site's accent color, as
            well as the original's iconic microscope. I went with a wordmark logo so it could 
            fit in the upper-left navbar where it would be readily seen by first-time visitors.
