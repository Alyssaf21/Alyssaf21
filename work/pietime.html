                    PieTime is a mobile timer app that illustrates your to-do list in the best way possible- like a pie.
                    Optimized for visual learners, PieTime keeps track of your tasks and sections your schedule into
                    sweet visual components so you can see how you're making the most of your day.

                    I absolutely love visual timers. They represent the passage of time in a
                    language I instantly understand, which is something sorely lacking in most productivity apps I've
                    tried over the years.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, there's no easy way to setup a series of timers that can track your progress
                    as you work through tasks consecutively- you can either set one big timer, or several smaller ones.
                    This can be
                    extremely disruptive when you're on a tight schedule, or if you already find it difficult to keep
                    track of
                    and switch tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, setting up schedules and to-do lists can be a time consuming and exhaustive process for
                    the people who
                    could benefit from it most. Given that our concentration is already <a

                        interaction costs on mobile</a> can quickly become a pain point, the solution would also have to
                    be
                    easy to set up and reuse on-the-fly.

                    To address these issues, PieTime takes inspiration from pie chart layouts and splits the timer
                    circle
                    into "slices"
                    that represent each task. As the circle becomes smaller, the user will be able to see how much time
                    to
                    spend on each
                    slice relative to the time they have remaining. This will help frame how each task relates to the
                    overall schedule, and
                    allow users to pace themselves accordingly.

                    For this project, I worked with two teammates and acted as the sole designer on the team.
                    My role included concept design, pitching, UX/UI design, prototyping, visual design, and front-end
                    implementation.
                    We made the wireframes and mockups in Figma, used Dart and Flutter to build the app, and Github for version control.
                    After making the prototype, the team set out to create a minimum viable product and drafted a prioritized list of features to 
                    add during the later stages of development.

                    As we progressed with development and became more familiar with Flutter, 
                    I adjusted the prototype as needed to suit the scope of what we could feasibly build.
                    By the end of roughly three months, we built a functional visual timer app with presets, 
                    the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks, and an animated display that contains each task
                    as a slice with a name and assigned duration- which went well beyond our MVP.  
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, PieTime gave a better understanding of how the initial concept, interface design, and 
                    front-end implementation play into the development process. It helped me recognize just how critical
                    mockups are as a shared point of reference for the team to build toward, and I plan to continue working
                    on it for the duration of the summer.
