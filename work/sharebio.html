                    Last summer, I overhauled the design of Sharebio- an intercollegiate
                    research sharing platform for bioinformatics studies. My primary role in the
                    project was to assist in moving Sharebio to a local server and to push some
                    updates and features to it before the second launch. This gave me the opportunity
                    to learn about setting up web servers in a Linux environment, but also allowed me
                    the creative freedom to engineer the site's user experience and overall design.

                    While I was working on testing project creation and modification, I noticed
                    that aside from the favicon, Sharebio's logo was only used once on the entire site.
                    The logo also used the site's tagline but didn't incorporate it's name, which made
                    it potentially confusing out of context. <br> <br>
                    The new logo makes use of the site's accent blue, as
                    well as the original's iconic microscope. I went with a wordmark logo so it could
                    fit in the upper-left navbar where it would be readily seen by first-time visitors
                    and help identify the site.

                    One of the biggest user experience challenges on the site was making the best of the
                    space available on each project thumbnail. Given that each project had a unique identifier
                    on the database but no way to view it on the front end, I added an ID number to each project,
                    which also helped distinguish projects with similar names or images.
                    <br> <br>
                    The other major consideration was permissions, since each user had to request access to view
                    and edit the files of other people's projects. Here, I used icons to indicate that the
                    status of each request, and to help communicate that projects would be opened elsewhere- in
                    this case, in a new tab on ownCloud, which was where all of the project files were stored.
